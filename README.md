**Dev Notes**

* Need to increase testing coverage.  Need to learn RSPec in more depth to do so.
* Views folder likely deprecated. Will remove after all functionality is handled elsewhere.


**Codebase Maintenance**

* Consolidate exceptions, too many unnecessary files.
* Should be able to simplify code considerably, it's on the backlog.
  * Default user options probably redundant
  * Everything within views likely redundant
